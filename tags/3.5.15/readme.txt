Author: Jehy
Tags: seo, link, links, publisher, post, posts, comments
Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 4.2.3
Stable tag: 3.5.15
Mask all external links - make them internal or hide. On your own posts, comments pages, authors page - no more PR\CY dropping!

== Description ==
> New feature - [extend plugin with your own functions](http://jehy.ru/articles/2014/12/08/custom-parser-for-wp-noexternallinks/)! For example, you can [encrypt links](http://jehy.ru/articles/2014/12/09/encrypting-links-for-wp-noexternallinks/).

This plugin has many cool features - outgoing clicks stats, fulllink masking, custom redirects,masking links to digital short code and base64 encoding and so on.It is designed for specialists who sell different kind of advertisment on their web site (for example, with [sape](http://www.sape.ru/r.f6054dfcc2.php) system) and care about the number of outgoing links that can be found by search engines. Now you can make all external links internal! In your own posts, comments pages, authors page... Plugin does not change anything or write to base - just processes output.

Now you don't need to worry about your page rank or index, dropping because of spam bots. You write any kind of http link - and it becomes internal or hidden! Of cause, all the links will still be usable :).

Warning: this plugin may conflict with your caching plugins, including Hyper Cache. Usually adding redirect page to caching plugin exclusions works fine, but I can't garantee that everything will go smoothly. By the way, after deactivation this plugins leaves no traces in your database or hard drive - so if you have you have problems after deactivation - please, search them in another source, for example, caching plugins. Flushing cache should help.

###New Features:

+ Extending plugin with custom functions   

####Version 3.3.2 implemented:   
+ Debug mode   

####Version 3.3 implemented:   
+ Masking links with base64 (quick and no need for mysql table)   

####Version 3.2 implemented:   
+ Completely removing links from your posts (someone requested this option)   
+ Masking links to text. Option for perverts.   

####Version 3.1 implemented:  
+ Masking links with digital short codes    

####Version 3.0 implemented:

+ FULL link masking    
+ No masking for registered users    

####Version 2.0 implemented:
+ You can configure plugin to mask ALL LINKS on your blog - including widget, theme footer, etc.    
+ Now you can also disable link rewriting, and use **"rel=nofollow"** and **&lt;noindex&gt;** tag instead of it - everything as you wish!   
+ From version 2.0 you can **make all links open in new window!**   
+ After many requests, I finally made an option to **disable masking** for concrete URLs and posts.  
+ Plugin works now without any magic with .htacess - you just install it and it works, and determines itself, if you need to rewrite permalinks, or use default link structure.  
Have fun!

####Example

To make the long story short, your links like "http://gmail.com" will be masked into  
"http://YourBlog.com/goto/http://gmail.com" - or  
"http://YourBlog.com?goto=http://gmail.com"

Now you can even tansform simple link "&lt;a href="http://google.com"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;" to   
"&lt;noindex&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://google.com"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noindex&gt;"

####Just one popular question :)
>  **- Is it an evil hack and black SEO?!**   
 - Before you say such awful things, read at least [Google's topics on SEO](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/topic.py?topic=8522)   

####Donate or help?
If you want to ensure the future development and support of this plugin, you can make donation [on this page](http://jehy.ru/articles/donate/) or just write about this plugin in your blog.

####Note
&lt;noindex&gt; tag is used mostly by russian search system "Yandex" (yandex.ru), and non-russian users don't usually need it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
####How can I exclude my page with links from masking?   
Now you just put URLS you need to the exclusion list, or disable masking for concrete post - and everything's OK!!!

####I removed your plugin but all links are masked!!!   
This plugin can't do it after uninstall. It doesn't change base or code of wordpress. Please,
* Remove another links plugin.
* Update your cache.
* Deactivate your caching plugin.

####How can I mask links in custom field?
You will have to add just a line in theme code where you output custom field data.    
To add same preprocessing for data as for comment text, use    
    $metadata=apply\_filters('comment\_text',$metadata);    
For example, if you use some kind of metadata, it should look like this:    
    $metadata = get\_post\_meta($id, 'MetaTagName', true);// get data from wordpress database    
    $metadata=apply\_filters('comment\_text',$metadata);// add this line of code for preprocessing field value    
    echo $metadata;//output preprocessed field value    

That's if you want to mask links in custom field like in comments text. Use "the\_content" instead of "comment\_text" if  you want to use the same masking policy as for post text.
