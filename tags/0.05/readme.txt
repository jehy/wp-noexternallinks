Mask all external links - make them internal. On your own posts, comments pages, authors page - no more PR dropping!

== Description ==

Mask all external links to internal! In your own posts, comments pages, authors page... It does not change anything or write to base - just processes output.

Now you don't need to worry about your page rank or index, dropping because of spam bots. You write any kind of http link - and it becomes internal! You can configure plugin to work with your own posts, comments and authors's profiles. Of cause, the link will still be usable - with headers.

####Example

In short, your links like "http://gmail.com" will be masked into  
"http://YourBlog.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-noexternallinks/goto?gmail.com" - or  
"http://YourBlog.com/goto?gmail.com" and if you use mod rewrite - smth like  
"http://YourBlog.com/goto/gmail.com"
