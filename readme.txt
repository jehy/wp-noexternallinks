This plugin will allow you to mask all external links to internal. Your own posts, comments pages, authors page...

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to mask all external links to internal. Your own posts, comments pages, authors page... It does not change anything or write to base - just processes output.  

Now you don't need to worry about your page rank or index, dropping because of spam bots. You write any kind of http link - and it becomes internal! You can configure plugin to work with your own posts, comments and authors's profiles.

####Example

In short, your links like "http://gmail.com" will be masked into   
"http://YourBlog.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-noexternallinks/goto?gmail.com" - or   
"http://YourBlog.com/goto?gmail.com" and if you use mod rewrite -  
 "http://YourBlog.com/goto/gmail.com"
